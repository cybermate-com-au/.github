## Our Mission
Cybermate's mission is to make Australia the most cyber-secure nation on Earth.

## Our Story
A few years ago, an employee of a friend’s small business opened an invoice from what appeared to be a legitimate client. The invoice was fake. Thousands of dollars, five months, and some employees later, the business was only beginning to gain its footing again after a successful phishing scam. This experience acted as the catalyst for our mission. How could a loyal, long-term employee in a successful business fall victim to a scam? We knew that psychology was the real key to cyber security.

A short while later, two motivated individuals, **Alastair Hood** and **Davide Defendi**, decided to take a stand for SMEs and founded **Cybermate**. We scoured the world, the internet, and everything in-between only to find components of a solution or products designed for large enterprises. That’s where our mission comes in: to make Australia the most cyber-resilient country in the world, starting with you.

We wanted to develop an easy, intuitive, and affordable way to mitigate risky human behavior and the margin for error—without compromising productivity. Now, our idea is a reality. **Cybermate is born.**

## The Cybermate Solution
We started from scratch to design a fully integrated system with advanced technology. It had to be **automated, easy, engaging**, and most importantly, **non-intrusive** to employees and businesses. To fulfill our mission, Cybermate needed to be **cost-effective and accessible**, making cyber security risk-free in all the ways that count.

### The Launch
With the platform completed, **Cybermate** was ready to launch. Enter **Greg Caleo**.

Cybermate partnered with **Greg Caleo** and the team at **Blue Hat Green (BHG)**, a specialist brand and marketing agency for technology brands, to launch the **Cybermate** brand in **ANZ**. In early **2022**, Cybermate was introduced with a **refreshed brand, a new website, and new positioning and messaging**, making it the **first affordable cyber awareness and training platform for SMEs that reduces human risk**.

Greg’s belief in Cybermate was so strong that he became a shareholder in **2022**. Later that year, in **December 2022**, Greg became the **majority shareholder** in Cybermate.

## Growing the Cybermate Team
With a **new brand, improved features, and a major Innovation Award**, the Cybermate team expanded to include:
